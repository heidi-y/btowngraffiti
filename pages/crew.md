As mentioned in the glossary section, a Crew is a group of graffiti writers who work on pieces together. Bloomington has its very own graffiti crew known as Act Crew or Act Squad. A significant number of the pieces in this collection were created by members of Act Crew. It's uncertain how many members of the crew there currently are, but I've counted at least nine different names associated with the Act Crew pieces. Check out the exhibit below to see the impressive work this crew pulls off. One of my favorite things about Act Crew is the variety in style and form of the pieces that they create! I hope you enjoy.

   Notice the fun smiley face effects in the background of this piece!

   The first piece in a three-part series celebrating "25 Years of Act Crew," this piece is a good example of graffiti lettering that is partially legible. You can make out some of the letters, but the design intentionally renders the word very difficult to read.

   The second piece in a three-part series celebrating "25 Years of Act Crew," this piece is illegible, meaning it's difficult to make out any of the lettering! Notice the way that the shines on the outline of the letters makes their 3-d dimensional effect really pop! This is a good example of 2-dimensional lettering with 3-d effects.

   The third piece in a three-part series celebrating "25 Years of Act Crew," this piece is partially legible. Notice the fade effect in the color of the letters and the way they seem to drip down at the bottom.

   This is a good example of a piece that is symmetrical. Many graffiti writers work to create symmetrical designs, imagine folding this word down the middle and notice how each side would perfectly align with the other.

   Another partially legible piece, notice the drip effects at the top of this piece compared to the bottom of it. Compare this piece to 25 Years of Act Crew #3 to see the varying types of fade effects graffiti writers employ within their lettering.

   This is a good example of a graffiti piece that has been written over by someone else. This is why it's important to document graffiti art! We can see previous iterations of a piece and notice how they change over time. The background of this piece seems to be deteriorating as well.

   This is a good example of an artist playing with background compositon. Notice how different each part of the background is and the way the color scheme creates coherence throughout the piece.
