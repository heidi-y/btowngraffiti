# Glossary of Graffiti Terms 

As you work through the collection, you may be wondering what some of the descriptive terms mean. Here's a place for you to find out! 

First, lets look at a few general graffiti terms. Descriptions for these terms come from <a href="https://upmag.com/graffiti-terminology/"> "Graffiti Terminology" by City Kurupt</a>

**Writer**: The terms for a person who practices graffiti art (e.g. graffiti writing)

**Crew**: Also known as a Cru, a Squad, or a Krew, a Crew is a group of graffiti writers who work together to create pieces. Check out the exhibit page to see one of Bloomington's Crews in action! 

**Tag**: A writer's tag name or signature. Many of the pieces in the collection are stylized representations of graffiti writer's tag names, however a piece and a tag are two different things. Tags are quickly created with few details added in.

**Throw-up/Throwie**: The next advancement after a tag, a Throw-up is a more complicated tag with larger bubble letters. They do not contain more than two colors and have a solid fill.

**Piece**: A piece is an intricate representation of an artist's name. It includes multiple colors, dimensional effects, fill shapes and fades, complicated outlines, and many more features (found in *Graffiti art style: a classification system and theoretical analysis*
 <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/228608106">(click for World Cat entry) </a>) that make is an impressive piece of art. Most of the objects in this collection are graffiti pieces.

**Mural**: A mural is not the same thing as a graffiti piece, though both are considered street art. Murals are not always performed with spraypaint and are often larger than graffiti pieces with more complicated subjects. A mural may try to tell a story in a way that a graffiti piece does not. The content and form of a mural has many more variables. In this collection, there are multiple portrait murals and surrealist murals.

**Toy**: A toy is a term used for graffiti that is not very skillful or complex. Characteristics of toys are that they are often prolific and not very well composed. Toys are looked down upon by graffiti writers.

# Glossary of Graffiti Styles 

Style types are taken from Lisa Gottlieb's *Graffiti Art Syles*, see above for a link to the World Cat entry to the text! 

**Abstract**: "Abstract pieces are described by graffiti artists as very organic in shape...The Abstract style is known as "Transcend," the name of the crew chiefly associated with this style."

**TFP**: 
"The name TFP refers to the Fantastic Partners crew, which was formed in New York City during the 1970s and still exists today. During the 1980s TFP was associated mainly with train pieces; the 1990s were marked by experimentation in wall pieces. One graffiti art expert notes that "this style is very colorful and eyecatching and many people feel this has historically been the high point of graffiti."

**Silvers**: 
"Found throughout the graffiti art world, Silver pieces are named for their silver-colored letter fill. This style is also characterized by speed...Silver pieces often have Scrub fills, the result of a technique used to fill-in letters very quickly."

**CTK**: 
"The name CTK refers to the Crime Time Kings, a prolific European crew." This style is definited by legibililty, being asymmetrical, having 2-dimensional with 3-d effect dimensionality, hard outlines, and varied letter strokes.

**Pichador**: 
"The Pichador style is derived from Pichaçäo, a tag-based lettering style native to São Paulo, Brazil. Pichaçäo tags are created using buckets of latex pain and 3-inch paint rollers. The use of rollers produces letters of uniform width." 

**Semi-wild**: 
"The name "Semi-wild" refers to the fact that this style is, in the words of one graffiti expert, "less severe" than the Wild style. Specifically, Semi-wild pieces tend to be legible, a result of the ltters having a standard, rather than intertwined overlap. Semi-wild is not simply "Wild-lite," however; it is a distinct style with its own set of characteristics."

**Los Angeles Cholo-Based**: 
"The phrase "Cholo-based" refers to the fact that the lettering in this style is based on graffiti created by Los Angeles Cholo gans in the 1930s." Pieces are colorful with more than 5 colors used, they are 2-dimensional with 3-d effects, have hard letter outlines, and varied letter strokes.

**Swedish Train**: 
"As with Silvers, Swedish Train pieces are executed quickly. As one graffiti art expert notes, "There is very little time for anything extraneous." This person also points out that the style "is very bubbly and has exaggerated proportions." Pieces are asymmetrical, are 2-dimensional with 3-d effects, have limited negati e space, and mininal letter overlap. 

**Neo Classic American Freight**: 
"As one graffiti art expert explains, this "neo-classic" style emerged as "a reaction to very abstract and unreadable freight pieces that were popular in 1999-2000." The Neo Classic American Freight style "hearkens back to subway days of teh 80s and takes shapes and connections that were popular then."

**East Coast Piecing Style**: 
"As indicated by its name, the East Coast Piecing style was developed in cities in the eastern United States, including Baltimore, Washington D.C., and Philadelphia. "This is a very complex, labor intensive style," one graffiti expert explains. "It was born in abandoned train tunnels and warehouse walls. Writers would spend all day trying to create the most complicated stylish piece."

**No-neg**: 
"This style originated in Boston, Massachusetts, and its name refers to the fact the letters in No-neg pieces have little or no negative space." 

{% include feature/image.html objectid="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heidi-y/collectionbuilder-draft/main/assets/img/No-neg.jpeg" width="75" alt="no-neg" caption="[Spray Daily](https://www.spraydaily.com/sueme-visited-boston-montreal/)"%}

**Dimensional**: 
Introduced by writers in Germany, this style reached the height of its international popularity during the 1990s. As the name suggests, the entirety of the letters in Dimensional pieces appear inherently 3-dimensional--a feat achieved through a combination of directional highlights and fades."

**Dortmund**: 
"The succinct style notation for the Dortmund style echoes one graffiti art expert's assessment that "this is a stripped down style and there isn't much focus on parts of the letters that aren't utilitarian." Reflecting this spare aesthetic, Dortmund pieces consist of "bold shapes" that are "very graphic" in nature. Named for its provenance in Dortmund, Germany, this style is predominantly train-based."

**Wild**: 
"Created in 1974 by teh writer Tracey 168 and named for his crew, this style has been synonymous with New York City subway writing." Wild style has hard outlines, intertwined letters, arrows, consistent fill, and partially legible words.
