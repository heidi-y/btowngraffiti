# Glossary of Graffiti Terms 

As you work through the collection, you may be wondering what some of the descriptive terms mean. Here's a place for you to find out! 

First, lets look at a few general graffiti terms. Descriptions for these terms come from <a href="https://upmag.com/graffiti-terminology/"> "Graffiti Terminology" by City Kurupt</a>

**Writer**: The terms for a person who practices graffiti art (e.g. graffiti writing)

**Crew**: Also known as a Cru, a Squad, or a Krew, a Crew is a group of graffiti writers who work together to create pieces. Check out the exhibit page to see one of Bloomington's Crews in action! 

**Tag**: A writer's tag name or signature. Many of the pieces in the collection are stylized representations of graffiti writer's tag names, however a piece and a tag are two different things. Tags are quickly created with few details added in.

**Throw-up/Throwie**: The next advancement after a tag, a Throw-up is a more complicated tag with larger bubble letters. They do not contain more than two colors and have a solid fill.

**Piece**: A piece is an intricate representation of an artist's name. It includes multiple colors, dimensional effects, fill shapes and fades, complicated outlines, and many more features (found in *Graffiti art style: a classification system and theoretical analysis*
 <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/228608106">(click for World Cat entry) </a>) that make is an impressive piece of art. Most of the objects in this collection are graffiti pieces.

**Mural**: A mural is not the same thing as a graffiti piece, though both are considered street art. Murals are not always performed with spraypaint and are often larger than graffiti pieces with more complicated subjects. A mural may try to tell a story in a way that a graffiti piece does not. The content and form of a mural has many more variables. In this collection, there are multiple portrait murals and surrealist murals.

**Toy**: A toy is a term used for graffiti that is not very skillful or complex. Characteristics of toys are that they are often prolific and not very well composed. Toys are looked down upon by graffiti writers.
