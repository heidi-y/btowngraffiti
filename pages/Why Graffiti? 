## Graffiti: The People's Art Form  
Graffiti was originally an illegal art form born from rebellion, underground culture, and the desire to make a personal mark on otherwise impersonal surroundings. However today, spaces like The Warehouse are making room for artists to display their work without the risk of it being removed by local authorities. 
Though popular conceptions of graffiti may associate the form with vandalism, as graffiti culture has become accepted and appreciated as an artform over the last few decades. With increased recognition from established art institutions, graffiti writers are being commissioned by private businesses, public service buildings, and nonprofit organizations to add their mark to walls all across the world. Travelling far beyond the New York City subways where it first started to gain traction in the 1970s, graffiti is now a part of cities internationally, from Munich to Sao Paolo. [^1]
Though institutionalized graffiti exists as legendary artists, from Banksy to Daze, appear in museums all across the world, I see graffiti as an art form of the people at its core. Any graffiti writer started off making a name for themselves by practicing in the street, gaining grassroots fame through word-of-mouth exchanges and in-your-face one upmanship. To be a successful graffiti artist takes skill, discipline, guts, and grit. Above all, when a graffiti writer creates an incredible piece, anyone walking by has the pleasure and the opportunity to enjoy it. No admission required. 
# Graffiti in the Midwest
In huge cities like NYC graffiti writers were able to make a name for themselves while protecting their anonymity. However, in smaller midwestern cities where graffiti writing was less prevalent, "the development of the style was limited by the fact that it was easier for the authorities to single out the few known writers and hold them responsible for anything painted on the walls and public transit." [^2]
With legal spaces like the Warehouse, graffiti writers don't have to wory about protecting their legal identities--though some may still choose to remain anonymous!
